# Spotify

Inspired by an interview with a majorlabel I want to dive deeper into music data. I'll use the Spotify API to get that data. This will be a nice exercise in working with APIs - and does justice to my passion for music.

Virtual environment:

```
pyenv local 3.9.8
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
