# Spotify

Let's see what I can find out about my favorite music...

In this notebook I created the data sets myself: with data that I got through Spotify Web API. There are (so far) 3 notebooks in which I got the audio data for the following artists:
- [All Them Witches](Get_data_All_Them_Witches.ipynb)
- [Rival Sons](Get_data_Rival%20Sons.ipynb)
- [The Streets](Get_data_The_Streets.ipynb)


### Virtual environment:

```
pyenv local 3.9.8
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
