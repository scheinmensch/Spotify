# Spotify

Let's see what I can find out about my favorite music...

In this notebook I created the data sets myself: with data that I got through Spotify Web API. There are (so far) 3 notebooks in which I got the audio data for the following artists:
- [All Them Witches](Get_data_All_Them_Witches.ipynb)
- [Rival Sons](Get_data_Rival%20Sons.ipynb)
- [The Streets](Get_data_The_Streets.ipynb)

The first artist for whom I analyze the audio data is [ALL THEM WITCHES](AllThemWitches.ipynb)

I first look at the variables in isolation and then at the relationships between them.

I may later compare different artists with each other or develop an ML model. The ideas will certainly come during the analysis.

In this repository, I place particular emphasis on the visualizations. Color schemes, fonts, etc. should be coordinated and match the theme.
